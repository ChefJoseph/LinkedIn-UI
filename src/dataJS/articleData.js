        body: "Celebrating my birthday today… in Paris… with my very first photo assignment for Paris Fashion Week printed in the international edition of the New York Times.  Life is crazy and hilarious at times. I’d shared a few months back that I had ‘left some dreams on the table’ when I came back to the corporate world after being a freelance photographer for many years. Those exact dreams were to 1) have a photo assignment with the New York Times and 2) cover Paris Fashion Week before I hung up my fashion week stripes for good. The fact that they both happened hand in hand, and during a season where I finally felt ready to do so, means the world to me on this special birthday. \A I feel so fortunate to be able to say that these achievements have been unlocked; but also not pictured are the years of rejection, evolution of my photography, the 13 seasons I spent covering NYFW to prepare for this very moment, and still being able to keep a grasp on that glimmer of hope & optimism after feeling like it was never gonna happen for me. \A All this to say— if you still have a dream in the back of your mind— I hope this story can serve as living proof that it really can happen when you least expect it.
